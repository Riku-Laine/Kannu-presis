- Some students have thought about changing to a new program, but majority want to stick with the old
- No regret noticeable, almost no one had rather applied to a new program

***

**Do you know the student representatives of your...?**

|                          |   No|  Yes|

|Program's executive group | 70.8| 29.2|


Some notes
===============================

- One big topic reflecting on all the answers is **the lack or unavailability of information**.
  * Marketing and informing has to be thought in a new way.
  * Good communication releases student counselling's resources when answers to "easy" questions are readily available.
- Although there has been "turbulence" in some students' studies, it isn't necessarily caused by the reform.
  * Economic issues? Mental issues? Health issues?
