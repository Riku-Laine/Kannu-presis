# Results of Kannunvalajat's study questionnaire

This file produces a presentation visible [here](https://riku-laine.github.io/Kannu-presis/index.html#/). The project was done *pro bono*
during Christmas holiday '17.

* Data available at the repository.
* Contains no actual statistical analysis
  - Worked as a practise on how to use R Presentation -- turns out, you shouldn't! (Use RMarkdown with `output: presentation`.)

Feel free to modify and improve the slide show.
